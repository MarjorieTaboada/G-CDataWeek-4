### Getting and Cleaning Data - Week 4 Coursera
This repository contains the R Code, codebook, and a tidy data set for assignment 4 in the getting and cleaning data available on Coursera.
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

## Files
codebook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains the coding that does the following steps: 
1- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2- Extract only the measurements on each measurement's mean and standard deviation. 
3- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The tidydata.txt is the output after the 5th step.
